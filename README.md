# phone-number-mnemonics
My first C++ project!

## Description
Convert each of the digits in a phone number to its associated letters, ultimately forming a word that exists in the file ShortList.txt!

## Examples
|Input|Output|
|-----|------|
|234-5678|beg lost|
|223-5653|abe joke, abe jole, be loke, ace joke, ace jole, ace loke, bad joke, bad jole, bad loke, cad joke, cad jole, cad loke|
|555-5555|No results!|

## Limitations
Phone numbers must be input in ###-#### form. Only digits ranging from 2 to 9 are valid (1 and 0 are not associated with a letter and are thus invalid).
